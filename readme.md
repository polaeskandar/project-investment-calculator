# Investment Calculator Using React.js

I developed this project as my first step into frontend development with React.js. The application was built exclusively with React components, without the use of any additional frameworks or libraries.
Thanks to the wonderful instructor Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller, I was able to complete this project as part of my journey in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).
